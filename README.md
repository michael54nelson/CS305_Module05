# CS305 Module05
This is a repository for the CS305 Module 05 assignment. 

I will also reference my CAPSTONE project, MapONE, [here](https://github.com/samantha-milligan/MapONE). 
As part of my team, I am working on a web scraper that identifies and pulls planetary maps from library catalogs such as LPI (Lunar Planetary Institute) and Springer.
